 * Ternary Operator Practice Questions
    1. Check Adult or Minor
    Write code to assign "adult" if a variable age is greater than or equal to 18; otherwise, assign "minor" using the ternary operator.

    Hint: Use the format: condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse for variable assignment.

    2. Empty String Check
    Create a variable output that stores "empty" if a string str is empty, or "not empty" if it is not, using the ternary operator.

    Hint: A string is empty if its .length equals zero.

    3. Positive, Negative, or Zero
    Write a program that takes a number num and prints "positive" if it’s greater than 0, "negative" if less than 0, or "zero" if exactly 0. Use nested ternary operators.

    Hint: You can nest ternaries like: condition1 ? result1 : condition2 ? result2 : result3.

    4. Maximum of Two Numbers
    Given a and b, assign maxVal to the greater value, or "equal" if they’re the same, using the ternary operator.

    Hint: Compare the values with > and use nested ternary if needed for "equal" case.

    5. String Contains a Character
    For a string word and a character ch, assign "contains" to result if word includes ch, else "does not contain"—using ternary.

    Hint: Use the .includes() method for string search: word.includes(ch)

    6. Check Even or Odd Number
    Write code to assign "even" if a variable num is even, or "odd" if it is odd, using the ternary operator.
    
    Hint: Use the modulus operator % to check evenness: num % 2 === 0.
    
    7. Grade Assignment
    Given a score variable score, assign "pass" if the score is 50 or higher, otherwise "fail", using the ternary operator.
    
    Hint: score >= 50 is the condition to check passing.
    
    8. Check for Null or Undefined
    Assign "no value" if a variable val is null or undefined; otherwise assign "has value" using a ternary operator.
    
    Hint: Use val == null to check both null and undefined because it loosely compares.
    
    9. Temperature Check
    Given temp, assign "hot" if temperature is over 30 degrees, "cold" if below 15, and "moderate" otherwise, using nested ternaries.
    
    Hint: Nested ternaries: condition1 ? val1 : condition2 ? val2 : val3.
    
    10. User Status
    For a boolean variable isActive, assign "active user" if true, or "inactive user" if false using the ternary operator.
    
    Hint: Directly use isActive in your condition without comparison
